Flink provides a CLI tool, bin/flink, that can run programs packaged as Java ARchives (JAR) and control their execution. Submitting a job means uploading the job’s JAR ﬁle and related dependencies to the running Flink cluster and executing it.

Flink releases come with example jobs, which you can ﬁnd in the examples/ folder.
